## 🚀 Projects Overview

### ✅ Project 1: Favorite Movie List

Practice lists, input, and string basics.

* Ask the user for 3 favorite movies.
* Save them in a list.
* Print:

  * Full list
  * First movie
  * Last movie
  * Number of movies

👉 **Hint:** Use `len()`, `list[index]`.

### ✅ Project 2: Age Check

Practice input, type conversion, and conditions.

* Ask the user for their age.
* If under 18 → print *“You are not an adult”*.
* Else → print *“You are an adult”*.
* Ask for birth year and calculate age (use `2025`).

---

### ✅ Project 3: Word Analysis Tool

Practice string methods, loops, conditions, lists, and sets.

* Ask the user for a sentence.
* Analyze:

  * Character count (excluding spaces)
  * Word count
  * Unique words (`set`)
  * Longest word

👉 **Hint:** Use `split()`, `len()`, `set()`.

### ✅ Project 4: Mini Market Basket

Practice dictionaries and loops.

* Products and prices:

  ```python
  products = {"apple": 3, "banana": 5, "bread": 2, "milk": 4}
  ```
* Ask the user for 3 products.
* Calculate total price.
* Print:

  ```
  Your basket: apple, banana, milk
  Total price: 12 TL
  ```
* If a product doesn’t exist → print warning.

### ✅ Project 5: Student Grading System

Practice dictionaries, lists, loops, and averages.

* Ask the user for **at least 3 students**.
* Each student gets 3 grades.
* Store in a dictionary:

  ```python
  students = {
      "Ali": [80, 90, 70],
      "Ayşe": [85, 75, 95],
      "Mehmet": [60, 70, 65]
  }
  ```
* Print each student’s average.
* **Extra:** Show the student with the highest average.

### ✅ Project 6: Mini Library Management System

Practice dictionaries, sets, loops, and string methods.

* Library dictionary:

  ```python
  library = {
      "Python101": "Available",
      "DataScience": "Available",
      "Algorithms": "Available"
  }
  ```
* Menu options:

  ```
  1 - Add Book
  2 - Borrow Book
  3 - Return Book
  4 - View All Books
  5 - Exit
  ```
* Features:

  * Add new book (`Available`)
  * Borrow → `Borrowed`
  * Return → `Available`
  * Show all books + statistics
  * Exit

👉 **Extra:**

* Make book names case-insensitive (`lower()`).
* Track borrowed books in a `set`.
* Prevent adding duplicate books.
